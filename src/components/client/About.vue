                      A Two years working experience front end programmer, I started to get into this industrial in about 5 years ago.
                      So we had a course called 'HTML & CSS Web Design' in college which made me very impressed,
                      I used to wonder how those amazing Web effects were made by codes, and I have to figure it out.
                      That`s the motivation that keeps me moving on.

                      Besides Coding, Basketball and RollingSkate also fullfill my spare life.
                      I dreamed of being a big Star when I was a kid ðŸ¤£but I stop growing taller when I was 18.
                      So I started to try something else to see if I could get a little bit taller,
                      and I bought my first skating shoes , and that changed my whole life..
