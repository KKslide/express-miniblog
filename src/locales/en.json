So then we had a course - 'HTML & CSS Web Design' during college which impressed me, that was so coool and so amazing!!! It turned out I was a visual effects lover. So I tried hard to teach myself html and css and catch up with JavaScript. I want to be a UI designer and front end engineer. That`s the motivation that keeps me moving on."
